# Introduction

> A long time ago a casual vimmer was sick of his premade config
> and desided to go and craft his own, his own way. This is his config

Xvim is a config for people who are sick of premade configs and want to
do it there own way

Its design is guided by these mantras:

+ **Gotta go fast.** Startup and run-time performance are priorities. Xvim opens faster and (Lazier)
+ **Close to metal.** Everything is easily customisable (Nothing tied to xvim)


# Features
- Minimalistic good looks inspired by modern editors.
- A declarative [package management system] (powered by
  lazy.nvim)
- LSP integration for many languages
- Support for *many* programming languages. Includes syntax highlighting,
  linters/checker integration, inline code evaluation, code completion (where
  possible), REPLs, documentation lookups, snippets, and more!
- Project-management tools and framework-specific minor modes with their own
  snippets libraries.
- File search utilities, powered by telescope

# Prerequisites
- Git 2.23+
- NVIM 0.11.2+ - Built with LuaJit

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Xvim is comprised of Many different plugins, some of which may have
> additional dependencies.
